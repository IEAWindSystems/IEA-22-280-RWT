Repository for 22MW offshore reference wind turbine developed by the IEA Wind Task 37

The design teams at DTU and at NREL are actively working on the model, please fee free to look around the repository, but be aware that the model is yet to be finalized! 

Whenever the first release is available, we will update this readme and we will send a note to the [IEA Wind Task 37](https://iea-wind.org/task37/) community.
