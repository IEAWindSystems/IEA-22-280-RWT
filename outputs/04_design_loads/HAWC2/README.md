# Turbine component interfaces Design Loads

The directional ultimate and fatigue load envelopes for every turbine component interface and blade section are provided, based on HAWC2 design load case simulations (DLC1.2, DLC1.3, DLC6.1 with no wind-wave misalignment). The extreme load values include design load case safety factors (1.35). The loads relate to the 'mid-chord' reference line of the respective component interface cross-section, given in each body coordinate system aligned with the HAWC2 ’c2def’ reference, with the directional angles 0deg corresponding to the positive X axis direction and 90deg to the positive Y axis. For the blade nodes, also the full load matrix including the contemporaneous forces and moments is provided in '$._blade_full.xlsx'.The position of the blade nodes in the HAWC2 blade root reference frame are given in 'blade_nodes.txt'.
